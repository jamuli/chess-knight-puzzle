# Chess Knight Puzzle

Practice visualizing chess moves with this simply (but deceptively difficult) puzzle.

## How to Play
Move the black knight to the next blinking square until the last square is reached. HOWEVER, you must avoid moving the knight to squares attacked by the queen and the square that the queen is currently on. 

Unlike normal chess.... the black knight will go first, and white has no moves it's just a puzzle not a standard chess game). 

## How Knights Move in Chess
Unlike other pieces that move in straight lines, knights make 'L-shaped' moves. As long as the space allows for it, knights can move two squares in any direction and another square along the opposite axis in either direction.
